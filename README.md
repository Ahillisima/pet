Welcome to my **pet project**, where I combine all the things I love about test automation: building clean page objects, using expressive Selenide syntax, verifying multi-level dropdowns, and yes - testing those tricky hover states too
This project is based on the demo site:  
ðŸ‘‰ [https://qa-automation-practice.netlify.app/](https://qa-automation-practice.netlify.app/)

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **Java 17**
- **Selenide** for UI testing
- **JUnit 5** with lifecycle annotations
- **Allure** for beautiful reports
- **Lombok** to reduce boilerplate
- **Gradle** for build management (optional Maven version possible)
